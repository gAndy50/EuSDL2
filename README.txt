About:

This is a wrapper of the SDL2 multimedia library for the Euphoria programming language. All major and
minor functions have been wrapped. You'll need a good understanding of the Euphoria programming lang-
uage in order to fully use this wrapper. Demos have been provided to serve as examples. This wrap-
per uses the 32 bit version of SDL2 as to provide for more compatibility between systems. Also, the
32-bit version of Euphoria 4.0.5 was used to also provide better compatbility between systems.

This wrapper has been updated for SDL 2.0.6 and has included new functions.
